# Advanced-Calculator
This is a advanced calculator which not only does basic arithmetic operations but also performs xor as well as binary to decimal and decimal to binary. I plan to add octal conversion as well as other opeartions that are present in a calculator as well. Stay Tuned
As promised New updates to the advanced calculator application. Mainly changed the button layouts along with adding functionalities like switching of numbers in binary operations without having to manually type them again. Gonna work on this more.
